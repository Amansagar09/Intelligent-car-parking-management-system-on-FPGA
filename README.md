  __ABSTRACT__                                                            
In this research, we introduce FPGA based car parking. The benefit of using FPGA  compare to software FLC is that the computation time reduction. Using this , we design automated car back parallel parking system also with complete FPGA based controller. This project is designed to implement a car parking system using Verilog. In this project, at the entrance of the parking system, a sensor is used to detect the presence of a vehicle. Once the sensor is triggered, a password is requested to open the gate. If the entered password is correct, the gate opens to let the vehicle in, otherwise, the gate remains locked. This project is implemented on Spartan 7board.

 __INTRODUCTION__ 
 
 Due to the technological innovations man is leading a comfortable life. But at the same moment these advancements have at times become troublesome. The number of people using their own cars has increased exponentially in the past ten or fifteen years. The car parking has become an immense issue especially in big cities. Two main reasons can be cited for this. One reason is the growth in population and the other is the security. Car theft has become an evil art nowadays. Now the question arises, is it possible to introduce such a system that would solve all these issues and will be intelligent too. We have provided an interface and software/ hardware module which is validated using a test case scenario. The extensive experimentation proves the feasibility of the approach. ICPM solves all the issues related to car parking such as finding free parking slots, improved invoice system and certainly the security issues. The work is aimed at providing such a system that would be feasible in the third world countries like Pakistan. Our approach is cost effective and it covers all the features of a complete intelligent car parking management system. The central idea of the project came from the troubles we face in parking our cars in our daily routine. The inspiration was always there but it required a rock-solid approach. The nuisance of parking cars is escalating day by day. Indeed a good design was required.
 
__Motivation to use Parking System:__

__New Revenue Streams__ – Many new revenue streams are possible with smart parking technology. For example, lot owners can enable tiered payment options dependent on parking space location. Also, reward programs can be integrated into existing models to encourage repeat users. 2.Integrated Payments and POS – Returning users can replace daily, manual cash payments with account invoicing and application payments from their phone. This could also enable customer loyalty programs and valuable user feedback.

__Real-Time Data and Trend Insight__ – Over time, a smart parking solution can produce data that uncovers correlations and trends of users and lots. These trends can prove to be invaluable to lot owners as to how to make adjustments and improvements to drivers.

__Reduced pollution__ – Searching for parking burns around one million barrels of oil a day. An optimal parking solution will significantly decrease driving time, thus lowering the amount of daily vehicle emissions and ultimately reducing the global environmental footprint.

__Enhanced User Experience__ – A smart parking solution will integrate the entire user experience into a unified action. Driver’s payment, spot identification, location search and time notifications all seamlessly become part of the destination arrival process.

__Optimized parking__ – Users find the best spot available, saving time, resources and effort. The parking lot fills up efficiently and space can be utilized properly by commercial and corporate entities.

__Reduced traffic__ – Traffic flow increases as fewer cars are required to drive around in search of an open parking space.

__Increased Safety__ – Parking lot employees and security guards contain real-time lot data that can help prevent parking violations and suspicious activity. License plate recognition cameras can gather pertinent footage. Also, decreased spotsearching traffic on the streets can reduce accidents caused by the distraction of searching for parking.

__Real-Time Data and Trend Insight__ – Over time, a smart parking solution can produce data that uncovers correlations and trends of users and lots. These trends can prove to be invaluable to lot owners as to how to make adjustments and improvements to drivers.
Decreased Management Costs – More automation and less manual activity saves on labor cost and resource exhaustion.
